<h1>HR Interview Questions</h1>
<p>An interview can be broadly seen as a formal meeting arranged to evaluate a prospective employee by obtaining his/her career-oriented details, like qualification and work-experience. An interview presents the applicants an opportunity to elaborate on certain components of their resumes and talk about
their areas of expertise. It also tests their ability to think critically and independently.</p>
<p>Depending on the position and the company you are getting hired for, you might need to appear in various types of interviews. We going to discuss here the following six types of interviews and also see what makes them so unique &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Behavioral Questions</li>
<li>Traditional Questions</li>
<li>Case Questions</li>
<li>Role-play questions</li>
<li>Industry-specific questions</li>
<li>Brainteasers</li>
</ul>
<h1>Behavioral Questions</h1>
<p>It is estimated that 80% of the interview is made up of behavioral questions. This type of interviewing is based on the philosophy that a detailed analysis of the way you acted in certain circumstances in your previous job will give a reliable indication of the way you will act in your new job too.</p>
<img src="/hr_interview_questions/images/behavioral.jpg" alt="Behavioral" />
<p>Behavioral questions will be experience-based and you need a lot of practice to be able to answer them in a satisfactory manner.</p>
<h2>STAR Technique</h2>
<p>To answer Behavioral Questions, employ the STAR technique &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>S = Situation</b> &minus; (recall an incident in your life that suits the situation)</p></li>
<li><p><b>T = Task</b> &minus; (recall an incident in your life that suits the task)</p></li>
<li><p><b>A = Action</b> &minus; (mention the course of action you opted to address the situation or task)</p></li>
<li><p><b>R = Result</b> &minus; (mention the result of your action and the outcome)</p></li>
</ul>
<section class="toggle">
<label><b>Q</b> &minus; Tell me about an incident where you worked effectively under pressure.</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p><b>S</b> &minus; My friends and I were to give a presentation on "Artificial Intelligence", however one of them unfortunately slipped and fell down the stairs the night before.</p>
<p><b>T</b> &minus; As we had already picked up specific sub-topics to talk on individually, this sudden addition of content did put a lot of pressure on us, especially because it had taken us months of research to come up with our material.</p>
<p><b>A</b> &minus; In order to not let this accident affect our team's performance, I took the responsibility of filling in for his topic too. The issue was that I had only one night to make myself familiar with his notes.</p>
<p><b>R</b> &minus; Thanks to my friends' assistance and my efforts, our team managed to complete the presentation successfully and we also got compliments from the Review Panel.</p>
</div>
</section> 
<p><b>Remember that these are only sample interview answers meant to give a general idea on the approach to Behavioral Interviews. You need to formulate your own answers to suit the context and scenario asked in the question.</b></p>
<h2>Sample Behavioral Interview Questions</h2>
<section class="toggle">
<label><b>Q1</b> &minus; Describe a bad experience you had working with your ex-employer</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Never bad-mouth previous colleagues and ex-employees. Instead of focusing on the details of the incident, put more emphasis on the part where you managed to make him see your point-of-view.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; “They were thinking from a different point of view, but in the end, they managed to understand my concerns as well.”</p>
</div>
</section> 
<section class="toggle">
<label><b>Q2</b> &minus; Describe how you handle disagreement.</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Applying STAR to this situation, recall an incident in your life that suits the question, mention what task you set to address the issue, the actions you took, and the results you got.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; “We had once designed a template for a group presentation, however one member wasn’t too happy with him being asked to conclude. I suggested he should give it a trial run. At the end, he realized that he was as good at concluding as he was at opening a presentation.</p>
</div>
</section> 
<section class="toggle">
<label><b>Q3</b> &minus; Explain a situation when you explained a complex idea simply.</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>This is a standard question in Customer Service, Sales &amp; Marketing, IT and education sectors. Provide specific, job-related examples.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; “Yes, I designed a presentation that explained all the points in a clear manner. I also created a document describing the concept in simple words and handed it to the audience.”</p>
</div>
</section> 
<section class="toggle">
<label><b>Q4</b> &minus; Describe a time when you had to adapt to a change at work.</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Asking about incidents where you had to change your style of working is very common in Behavioral Interviews. Recruiters want to check your adaptability skills, as someone with a firm notion won’t be flexible to adjust to a process.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; “The management had decided to move on to Macintosh for all their company devices which took a bit of getting used to, however I spent a lot of time on it and this practice helped me a lot.”</p>
</div>
</section> 
<section class="toggle">
<label><b>Q5</b> &minus; Describe a time when you made a mistake.</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Companies prefer candidates who have made mistakes in the past and have learnt from them, as opposed to those who follow rules only because someone has told them to. They need people who know the reason behind a decision.</p>
<p>Mention the mistake and be honest about it, but always make sure that you follow it up with what you learnt from that episode and the improvements it has brought to your efficiency.</p>
<p><b>For example</b>  &minus; “In the first week of my appointment, I had miscalculated the estimated time needed to complete a project assigned to me, which resulted in a chain of miscommunications. It taught me that deadlines are to be respected.”</p>
</div>
</section> 
<section class="toggle">
<label><b>Q6</b> &minus; Describe a time when you delegated tasks to team-mates.</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Questions about managing teams are not asked only in managerial jobs. Employers want to see managerial skills in their employees. They want people in their team who can motivate others and accomplish a task in a given time-frame. The best way to answer such questions will be to base your answer on capability, experience, task force, etc.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; “Based on their individual strengths, I delegated the complex algorithm-writing tasks to Tarun, as he has more experienced than the others. I asked Rohan to handle data check, as he was very accurate in his testing skills. I handled QA, as I had maximum experience in Quality Analysis.” </p>
</div>
</section> 
<section class="toggle">
<label><b>Q7</b> &minus; Describe when you were blamed for somebody else’s mistake.</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>These types of questions are designed to check your personality and skills at handling stressful situations. The standard rules of interviewing answers apply here too &minus; no bad-mouthing ex-employees or supervisors.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; “Once I was blamed for not taking a sufficiently-detailed survey in a locality, which affected our sales figures for that month. Although I was not in the Marketing Analysis team, I took a note of the issue and, without passing blame, politely passed it to the concerned department.</p>
</div>
</section> 
<section class="toggle">
<label><b>Q8</b> &minus; Describe a difficult situation that you faced and how you handled it.</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>When questions like these are asked, give an answer that portrays your ability to identify, analyze, and solve problems.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; "We were getting a lot of complaints about the customers not getting the deliveries on time. I met the Manager of Delivery Department and he told me that the problem was acute during peak traffic hours. We both charted alternative routes with lesser traffic congestion during peak hours, i.e., 5:00PM till 8:00PM. Due to our efforts, our complaint call volume was reduced by 30%."</p>
</div>
</section> 
<section class="toggle">
<label><b>Q9</b> &minus; Describe a new suggestion that you had made to your supervisor</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>The ability of being a self-starter who likes to explore suitable alternatives of arriving at a solution and coming up with practical ideas are very important at any workplace.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; "Our Company had launched a new product and the Sales Team were getting trained on it. We, being from the Orders Department, were not privy to the training. I requested the Management to include us in the training team too, as that would help us understand the orders and provide better solutions to customers.”</p>
</div>
</section> 
<section class="toggle">
<label><b>Q10</b> &minus; Describe when you had to take a judgement on a difficult decision.</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>By asking this question, the interviewer is checking your ability to implement logical decisions. You need to express your logical method of thinking out each step, calculating the implementation with team-mates, weighing in alternatives, and choosing the best action route.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; "I was assigned the task of purchasing office equipment. We used to follow a "purchase-per-month" mode of purchase and payment. I thought of opting for a bulk purchase of six months, as I could hardly see the difference in payment in the per-month structure. Also, by ordering in bulk, we could get discounts and freebies. We opted for a bulk purchase in January, which proved to be a wise decision, as the prices of electronic goods increased by 15% with the new budget."</p>
</div>
</section> 
<h1>General Interview Questions</h1>
<p>Compared to Behavioral Questions that deal with your situation-handling in a past scenario, Traditional or <b>General Interview Questions</b> tend to be more hypothetical. They can be asked in any interview and they don’t specifically cater to any particular job responsibility.</p>

<p>It is always advisable to memorize a few keywords on the company’s needs, problems, or goals. Make sure you visit the company’s website before the interview to uncover the needs of this specific job profile, instead of the generalized needs of the industry.</p>
<h2>Sample General Interview Questions</h2>
<section class="toggle">
<label><b>Q1</b> &minus; Tell me about yourself.</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Unlike 80% of the candidates who ramble about their life story and personal matters, start with the present and explain how your qualifications match to what the interviewer is looking for, and how you are an ideal candidate for the job. This approach will help you stand out instantly from the rest of the aspirants and will help you build a rapport very early.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; "I have a number of accomplishments I'd like to tell you about, but I would like to talk more about the most important priorities of this position. I know from (company’s website, newspaper ad, from references, etc.) that these are the requisites for this job profile. Is there anything else you see as essential for this position?”</p>
</div>
</section> 
<section class="toggle">
<label><b>Q2</b> &minus; What are your greatest strengths?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Most aspirants sound either too arrogant or humble while answering these questions, neither of which helps. The key skill here is to mention work-elated strengths along with their most recent and impressive examples respectively.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; The qualities employers generally seek in employees are &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered"> 
<tr>
<td style="width:50%;">Proven Performance Record</td>
<td style="width:50%;">Intelligence</td>

<tr>
<td>Familiarity with Corporate Culture</td>

<label><b>Q3</b> &minus; What are your greatest weaknesses?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>First of all, there’s nothing “great” about a weakness, so that’s a trick question; it should be “What are your biggest weaknesses?”</p>
<p>Second, being honest about your weaknesses might earn you brownie points on sincerity, however a candidate with weaknesses isn’t a charming prospect for any company. Many tackle this question by trying to present their excessive implementation of a positive quality as a negative feature.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; “I strive to achieve perfection, so I tend to work too hard.”</p>
<p>However, these tactics have been used for so long now that every HR will see through it. The best way to answer this question is to first get a detailed knowledge of the job’s requirements, and then describe what you like doing the most, which should match up with the most important qualification in the position. Also, mention what you like the least, which should match with a qualification not at all needed for the job.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; If you are applying for a job that needs knowledge on Website Designing, say &minus;</p>
<p>"Nobody's perfect, but if my background is anything to go by, I have the qualifications, skills and focus to achieve results in this position. If given a choice, I like to spend the majority of my employed time in designing the websites, as opposed to Data Warehousing. Of course, I know the importance of Data Warehousing, but my real interest lies in website designing." (The HR’s heart would be singing in delight on hearing those words.)</p>
</div>
</section> 
<section class="toggle">
<label><b>Q4</b> &minus; Tell me about an incident you are ashamed of speaking about</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Although it’s one of those extremely personal questions that the interviewer has no business asking, it’s extremely effective in inducing guilt and repentance from an unprepared candidate, which could lead to disaster.</p>
<p>Never treat a mistake you made as something shameful, as that means you have difficulty in moving on, instead of learning from the mistake and avoiding that in your present life. Never regret or apologize for a mistake.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; “I have always found the best way to manage a shameful act is to not do it in the first place. I always cross-check my references and prepare the task-chart for the next day well in advance, so that I am rarely caught on the wrong foot.”</p>
</div>
</section> 
<section class="toggle">
<label><b>Q5</b> &minus; Why did you leave (or plan to leave) your present employer?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>As a rule of thumb, never badmouth your previous company, boss, staff, or employees, under any circumstance. If you are already in a job, state honestly and clearly what you expect in your new job. The best keywords could be – better career opportunities, growth, exposure to a different working culture, new process, etc.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; Never lie if you have been laid-off the job, as it’s very easy to find out. Instead of taking the question personally, try to divert the reasons for your getting fired as &minus; “company takeover, merger, and division wide layoff."</p>
<p>Instead of being bitter about the experience, try to describe the incident practically from the company's point-of-view, indicating that you might have done the same thing yourself, had you been in their position. This will increase your value in the eyes of the interviewer(s) as excellent top-management material.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label><b>Q6</b> &minus; The Silent Treatment</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p> A favorite of the HRs who put candidates in Stress situations, this technique involves the interviewer remaining completely silent and just keep on staring back after an aspirant has answered the question. This uncomfortable and prolonged silence has an unnerving effect on even the most seasoned job-seekers.</p>
<p>Most unprepared candidates think they might have said something extremely wrong which they have to cover now. But as they don’t know what was wrong in the first place, they break under the stress and rush to fill in the silence by rambling about unnecessary details, which might be extremely dangerous to your chances.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; If your interviewer remains silent for an uncomfortable duration after listening to your answer, keep quiet for some time and then, say very politely &minus; "Is there anything else I need to mention on that point?"</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label><b>Q7</b> &minus; Why should I hire you?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p> Before answering any such question, do a thorough study of the position’s requirements and what skill-sets the job might need. This knowledge will help you immensely in matching your qualifications and experience with the job requirements, which in turn, enhances your image in the eyes of the HR and sets you apart from the competition.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; "As per my knowledge, you are looking for a Sales and Marketing Manager for your book-publishing department. I would like to mention that I have a strong background in trade book sales, 18 years of experience to be exact. I know the right contacts, methods, and management techniques that are needed for success in our industry.”</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label><b>Q8</b> &minus; Where do you see yourself five years from now?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>The reason interviewers ask this question is to check your level of commitment to the job and company. They want to know if you are just filling in till a better opportunity comes along, or are you looking for a long-term association with the organization.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; "This position is exactly what I'm looking forward to working in on a long term, and I'm confident that if I do my work with sincerity and the desired level of proficiency, opportunities will inevitably open up for me."</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label><b>Q9</b> &minus; Why do you want to work at our company?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p> The deeper your research is on the company’s annual reports, the corporate newsletters, business contacts, partners, suppliers, advertisements and articles about the company in the trade press, the better chance you have at answering this question satisfactorily.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label><b>Q10</b> &minus; Would you lie for the company?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>This is one of the trickiest questions in the world of interviewing, as it pits two morals against each other &minus; loyalty vs. honesty.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; In these cases, try to give an answer that’s as diplomatic as possible, like &minus; “I will never do anything that could cast a shadow on the company’s image and reputation. I will always consult with my seniors before taking a decision, so that they can guide me with their expertise and level of experience.”</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label><b>Q11</b> &minus; Questions on confidential matters.</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Your interviewer may press you for this information for two reasons. First, to research the competition on their strategies, financial condition, etc. Second, to test your integrity to see if you can easily reveal confidential data. Never reveal anything truly confidential about a present or former employer, but politely explain the reason too.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; "I certainly like to be as clear as possible, however I would also like to honor the trust my previous employer had on me, when they shared sensitive information, as I am sure you would also want your employers to do.” </p>

<h1>Case Study Interview Questions</h1>
<p>Case study based interview questions are unique because answering them requires identifying the root causes and developing an action plan based on a logical analysis.</p>
<img src="/hr_interview_questions/images/case_study.jpg" alt="Case Study" />
<p>In Case Interviews, interviewers tend to not mention important figures and details. They want to see if you have a clear idea on the industry and on what assumption you will solve the problem. In these situations, it’s okay to consider assumed data, but they need to be based on facts and logic.</p>
<h2>Answering Case Interview Questions</h2>
<p>Answering case interview questions can be tricky, especially when you don’t get the facts right. Do use the following tips to tackle such questions &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Listen carefully</b> &minus; Paraphrasing helps in understanding the question completely before answering.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Take time to think</b> &minus; Because of the sheer number of parameters needed to tackle the issue, candidates are expected to take some time to ponder on the scenario, however anything more than five minutes would be excessive.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Ask questions</b> &minus; Interviewers deliberately give incomplete questions to check the candidates’ understanding of relevant parameters, so they expect a lot of questions from you which makes the entire interview quite interactive.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Use a logical framework</b> &minus; Apply the principles you learned in business colleges as a framework. Examples include Porter's Five Forces and the SWOT analysis.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Prioritize objectives</b> &minus; Start addressing the most important objectives and concerns and gradually move towards relatively non-priority topics.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Try and think outside the box</b> &minus; Many interviewers are on the lookout for employees who can bring in creativity to their problem-solving process.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Exhibit enthusiasm</b> &minus; Behaving as though you feel it's fun to tackle this kind of problem is integral to showing how well you'd fit in as a consultant or whatever position you're interviewing for.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Standard Case Interview Questions</h2>
<h3>Market-Sizing Case Interview Questions</h3>
<p>Market-Sizing Case Interview Questions need the candidates to guess the market size for a specific product. To answer these questions, you need to have a close idea on the population of the country, the male-female ratio, different demographics, among many other parameters. A few popular examples are &minus;</p>
<p><b>Q.</b> How many light bulbs are there in Delhi?</p>
<p><b>Q.</b> How many people read gossip magazines in Mumbai?</p>
<p><b>Q.</b> How many photocopies are taken in Odisha each year?</p>
<p><b>Q.</b> How much beer is consumed in the city of Chandigarh?</p>
<h3>Business Case Interview Questions</h3>
<p>These questions need knowledge on the internal working of a company. Visit their website and collect as much information as possible on their way of operations.</p>
<p><b>Q.</b> You are working directly with <b>&lt;company’s name&gt;</b> management team. It is organizing a project designed to increase the revenue significantly. If you were provided with data and asked to supervise the project, what steps would you take to ensure its success?</p>
<p><b>Q.</b> The firm has assigned you to consult <b>&lt;company’s name&gt;</b> intending to drop a product or expand into new markets in order to increase revenue. What steps would you take to help this company achieve its objective?</p>
<p><b>Q.</b> You have been assigned to consult <b>&lt;shoe retailer’s name&gt;</b> with stores throughout the nation. Since its revenue is dropping, the company has proposed to sell food at its stores. How would you advise this client?</p>
<h3>Logic Problems</h3>
<p>Questions involving logic problems require you to be able to perform numeracy quickly. The following are a few logic problems.</p>
<section class="toggle">
<label><b>Q1</b> &minus; At 3:15, how many degrees are between two hands of a clock?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>If you thought the answer was zero degrees, you'd be incorrect. At 3:15, the clock's minute hand will be pointing at 15 minutes, exactly 90 degrees clockwise from vertical. At 3:15, the clock's hour hand will be exactly one quarter of the distance between 3 O'clock and 4 O'clock. Each of the 12 hours on the clock represents 30 degrees (360 degrees divided by the 12 hours on the clock). Consequently, one quarter of an hour is exactly 7.5 degrees &minus; so at 3:15, the minute hand will be at 97.5 degrees. So there is a difference of 7.5 degrees between the hour hand and the minute hand at 3:15.</p>
</div>

<label><b>Q2</b> &minus; A fire fighter has to get to a burning building as quickly as he can. There are three paths that he can take. He can take his fire engine over a large hill (5 miles) at 8 miles per hour. He can take his fire engine through a windy road (7 miles) at 9 miles per hour. Or he can drive his fire engine along a dirt road which is 8 miles at 12 miles per hour. Which way should he choose?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Driving his fire engine 5 miles at 8 miles per hour takes 37.5 minutes. Driving his fire engine 7 miles at 9 miles per hour takes about 47 minutes. Driving his fire engine 8 miles at 12 miles per hour takes 40 minutes. So he should choose to drive his fire engine over the hill.</p>

<section class="toggle">
<label><b>Q3</b> &minus; You spend 21 dollars on vegetables at the store. You buy carrots, onions, and celery. The celery cost half the cost of the onions. The onions cost half the cost of the carrots. How much did the onions cost?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Answering this problem just requires some simple algebra. If we assume the cost of celery = x, then the cost of onions = 2x, and the cost of the carrots is 4x, such that the total cost of all vegetables = x + 2x + 4x = 7x = 21 dollars. Consequently, x = 3 dollars. Hence, the onions cost 6 dollars.</p>

<h1>Role-Play Questions</h1>
<p>Role-plays are considered opportunities to prove that you possess all the key interpersonal skills you have mentioned in your resume. They help employers to assess how you'll react in certain situations. During a role-play, the interviewer assumes the role of a customer/client and asks you to sell him an idea or a product.</p>
<p>Questions like "why should I go with your company?" "What advantages can you offer me?" or "Why are your products so highly-priced when &lt;rival company’s name&gt; delivers the same products at such an inexpensive price?” are commonly asked.</p>
<img src="/hr_interview_questions/images/role_play.jpg" alt="Role-Play" />
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<p>In role-play questions, it’s always advisable to have a detailed knowledge of the company beforehand. Collect as much information on the company’s policies, recent achievements, their closest competitors’ best-selling products, etc.</p>
<h3>Teamwork</h3>
<p>In some cases, the role-play may feature a group role-playing exercise. In these situations, try your best to be an efficient team-leader but don’t try to dominate. Try to get a balance between listening and speaking.</p>
<h3>Composure</h3>
<p>Be calm and composed under every situation. Don’t laugh or embarrass people who couldn’t satisfactorily participate in the role-play activity.</p>
<h2>Sample Role-play Interview Questions</h2>

<label><b>Q1</b> &minus; Sell me this pen.</label>
