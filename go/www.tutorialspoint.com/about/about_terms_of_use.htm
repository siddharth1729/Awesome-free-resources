<p>If a video course you purchased is not what you were expecting, you can place a credit/refund request, within 30 days of your purchase of the course. You can use the credits towards your next course purchase on our website. No credit or refund will be issued if you request it after the 30-day guarantee time limit has passed.</p>
<p>Tutorials Point believes in complete transparency and maintaining a thoroughly accountable system. You are entitled to a 100% refund for  a video course purchased as long as-</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>The refund is requested within 30 days of purchase of the online course.</li>
<li>Not more than 2 videos sessions have been watched.</li>
<li>No provided material along with the video course has been downloaded.</li>
<li>No course certificates have been issued.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can request for a refund from the provided option along with the subscribed course. All the approved refunds will be paid within 15-20 business days from the date of the approval being granted by the Company.</p>
<p>At our discretion, if we believe you are abusing our credit/refund policy, we reserve the right to ban your account and restrict all future use of our Services.</p>
<p>Before you go ahead and purchase an eBook, we encourage you to go through the sample chapters provided and make sure the material of the eBook is as per your expectation.</p>
<p>Tutorials Point will not be able to refund/replace the downloaded eBooks due to the electronic nature of the content, though we can re-issue the same eBook in case you receive it in damaged condition.</p>
<h2>Revenue Sharing and Payments</h2>
<p>When an instructor or a publisher hosts a course or an eBook on our website and we sell that course or eBook to our students, the revenue generated by the paid courses will have 45% revenue share for the company and the remaining 55% revenue will be shared with the instructor or the publisher.</p>
<p>If a student purchases a course or an eBook in India, then it requires us to remit sales taxes, good and service tax (GST), or other similar transaction taxes ("Transaction Taxes"), under applicable law, we will collect and remit those Transaction Taxes to the competent tax authorities for those sales. If the student purchases the course from outside India through Paypal, GST is not applicable, but paypal gateway charges would be applicable.</p>
<p>When a student purchases a course, we calculate the gross amount of the sale as the amount actually received by Tutorials Point from the student ("Sale Amount"). From this, the applicable taxes and payment gateway transaction charges are deducted to calculate the net amount of the sale ("Net Amount").</p>
<p>Your revenue share will be 55% of the Net Amount.  Tutor or Publisher residing in India will have to furnish PAN card details for TDS deduction of 10% as per government norms. For Tutor or Publisher based outside India, TDS will not be deducted from your revenue share.</p> 
<p>We process the payments in the first week of every month. Any sell becomes mature after its 30 days guarantee period is over. Once a sell is matured, we credit the payments of that sell in the first week of the subsequent month. We reserve the right not to pay out funds in the event of identified fraud, violations of intellectual property rights, or other violations of the law.</p>
<p>We have the following two methods to remit your payments based on your locality:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>If you are an instructor/publisher residing in India, we remit your payments directly in your bank account through online bank transaction. To process your payments, we will require your bank account details such as account number, account holder’s name, bank name, branch name, and IFSC code.</p></li>
<li><p>For instructors/publishers who reside outside India, we disburse the payments in U.S. dollars (USD), through PayPal, regardless of the currency with which the sale was made. You must own a PayPal account and keep us informed of the correct email associated with your account, in order for us to release your payments in a timely manner. We will assume transaction processing fees excluding foreign currency conversion fees. Your revenue report will show the sales price in Indian Rupees (INR) and your converted revenue amount in US Dollar (USD).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If required by the government agencies, we may demand any tax or other related documents from you. We reserve the right to withhold payments or impose other penalties if we do not receive proper identifying information or any other related documentation from you.</p>
<p>You understand and agree that you are ultimately responsible for any applicable taxes on your income to your local authorities.</p>
<p>All transaction details pertaining to the sales of the courses and eBooks that the Instructor/Publisher owns, and uploads will be provided inside user account.</p>
<p>When creating a course on our website, you will be prompted to set a price for your course and how much discount you want to offer. You may alternatively choose to offer your course for free. Company holds the right to revise the price if you opt to include your course for promotional activities.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that students have the right to receive a refund. Instructors/Publishers will not receive any revenue from transactions for which a refund has been granted under this Terms of Use.</p>
<p>If we make any change in our Revenue Sharing and Payments policy, we will inform you the same through email or posting a notice through our Services and provide you 30 days’ notice.</p>
